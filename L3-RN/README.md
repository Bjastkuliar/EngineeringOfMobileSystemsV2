# Lab 3: React Native Practice

The goal of this lab is to practice React Native, starting with the code from lesson 5. In it, we defined a list of users, that we are displaying. Of note, these users are the same as the ones you will use for the assignment, so this lab will also be useful to familiarize yourself with the assignment.  

You can extend this code in the following ways:
- Change the style of the components to increase the spacing between users, and the padding around their profile pictures. Display the last name in bold font (but not the title or the first name).
- Display each user's phone numbers and email address, being mindful of the style of the application. For this, you can consult the [layout documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flexbox).
- Change the background of each user to reflect a different color for each country (you can only take a subset of the countries, you don't need a color for all).
- Highlight the users that have a weak password (a weak password being a password of length less than 8 characters).
- Define an enhanced view of each user, showing more data, such as their city, their country, their phone number, and a larger picture. For this, you can consult the [layout documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flexbox).
- Define a "full screen" view of each user, showing as much detail as possible in one screen. Use the "select from list" idiom so that tapping one of the users will show it, also allowing for the user to be deselected.
- Add a text field on top of the application to implement a search box. Entering text filters the list of diplayed users so that they match the search string.
- Change the behaviour of the list so that it changes the way users are rendered depending on how many search results there are. Many users will have a compact view, few will have an expanded view, and a single results switches to the full screen view.
