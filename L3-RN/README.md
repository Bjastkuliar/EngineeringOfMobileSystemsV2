# Lab 3: React Native Practices

The goal of this lab is to practice React Native, starting with the code from lesson 5. In it, we defined a list of users, that we are displaying. Of note, these users are the same as the ones you will use for the assignment, so this lab will also be useful to familiarize yourself with the assignment.

You can extend this code in the following ways:

<div data-snack-id="@rrobbes/rn-basics" data-snack-platform="web" data-snack-preview="true" data-snack-theme="light" style="overflow:hidden;background:#F9F9F9;border:1px solid var(--color-border);border-radius:4px;height:505px;width:100%"></div>
<script async src="https://snack.expo.io/embed.js"></script>
